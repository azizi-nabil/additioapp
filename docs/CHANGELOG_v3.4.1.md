# Changelog v3.4.1

**Release Date:** December 10, 2024

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Calculated Grades
- **Fixed calculated grades not appearing for all students**: Previously, calculated grade items only showed values for students who already had other grade records. Now all students in the class receive calculated grades immediately.

## ✨ New Features

### Grade Entry
- **Sort by Score**: Added ability to sort students by their scores (ascending or descending)
- **Sort State Display**: The sort button now shows the current sort mode (A-Z, Z-A, ID, Score ↑, Score ↓)

## 🔧 Improvements

### UI
- Shortened sort option labels for cleaner display:
  - "ID/Matricule" → "ID"
  - "Score ↑ (Low to High)" → "Score ↑"
  - "Score ↓ (High to Low)" → "Score ↓"
